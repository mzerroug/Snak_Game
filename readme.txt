# Snake Game in Java 🐍

A classic **Snake Game** implemented using Java. The game allows the player to control a snake, which grows longer as it collects apples. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's body while collecting apples to increase the snake's length.

---

## Features ✨

- **Snake Movement**: Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- **Random Colors**: Randomized colors for the snake and apples to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Growing Snake**: Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Simple UI**: A basic graphical interface built with Java’s Swing framework.

## Getting Started 🚀

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mzerroug/Snak_Game.git
cd Snak_Game
```

### 2. Compile the project:
If you wish to compile the project locally, use the following commands:
```bash
javac src/*.java
```

### 3. Run the game:
After compiling the game, use the following command to run it:
```bash
java src.Main
```

Alternatively, you can run the pre-packaged JAR file:
```bash
java -jar Snake.jar
```

### 4. Controls:
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake in the respective direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.

## Game Mechanics 🎮

1. **Apple Spawning**: Apples appear randomly on the game screen. Each time the snake consumes an apple, it grows.
2. **Snake Length**: The snake's body grows as it collects apples.
3. **Collision Detection**: If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends.
